We focus on We did in situ experiments (video link here), fish visual censuses and food web modelling to forecast to what extent temperature affects reef fish trophic interactions in the Western Atlantic and modeled projections of changes in reef food web species due to climate change.¬†\n\n\n\nExperiment setup with GoPro camera and the herbivorous fish Acanthurus chirurgus individual in frame at the Rocas Atoll, Western Atlantic.
