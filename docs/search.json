    "text": "Project description\nCoral reefs are among the most diverse and sensitive ecosystems on the planet, with multiple reports of severe impacts by ocean warming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen questions adressed:\n\n\n\n\nTo what extent sea warming influence reef species standing biomass?\nDoes sea warming change the ecosystem energy transfer efficiency ?\nDo species trophic interaction strenght modulate sea warming influence ?\n\n\n\nTo understand the impacts of ocean warming on reef ecosystems, we investigated the potential future effects of human-induced ocean warming on standing biomass in reef food webs using a near-pristine tropical reef ecosystem in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean as a model. We focus on We did in situ experiments (video link here), fish visual censuses and food web modelling to forecast to what extent temperature affects reef fish trophic interactions in the Western Atlantic and modeled projections of changes in reef food web species due to climate change.¬†\n\n\n\nExperiment setup with GoPro camera and the herbivorous fish Acanthurus chirurgus individual in frame at the Rocas Atoll, Western Atlantic.

An ecologist is someone who finds excitement in the beauty and complexity of nature.\n\nAnd so an ecologist who begins by asking himself how life works very quickly finds himself asking instead why the natural ecosystems are made up of so many parts and why there are so many of each kind of part. Before he can answer an engineer‚Äôs question ‚Äúhow does this work,‚Äù he is faced with even more fundamental questions beginning with ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: Why are there so many different kinds of plants and animals? Why are some common but others rare? Why are some large but others small? Why do they sometimes do such peculiar things?\nPaul Colinvax, 1978. Why big fierce animals are rare?
