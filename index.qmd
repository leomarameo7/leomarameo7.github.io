## Welcome to my personal web page! Who am I?

I quote Paul Colinvaux:

> And so an ecologist who begins by asking himself how life works in those splendid perpetual systems very quickly finds himself asking instead why the natural ecosystems are made up of so many parts and why there are so many of each kind of part.\
> Before he can answer an engineer's question *“how does this work,”* he is faced with even more fundamental questions beginning with *“why”*:\
> Why are there so many different kinds of plants and animals? Why are some common but others rare? Why are some large but others small? Why do they sometimes do such peculiar things?
