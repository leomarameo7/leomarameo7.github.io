::: {#heading}
This research project contains three sub projects that I have done during my Ph.D. in Ecology at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. I have received funding by the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education ([CAPES](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br)), and started in June 2017.

## Project description

Coral reefs are among the most diverse and sensitive ecosystems on the planet, with multiple reports of severe impacts by ocean warming.

## Open questions adressed:

-   To what extent sea warming influence reef species standing biomass?

-   Does sea warming change the ecosystem energy transfer efficiency ?

-   Do species trophic interaction strenght modulate sea warming influence ?
:::

To understand the impacts of ocean warming on reef ecosystems, we investigated the potential future effects of human-induced ocean warming on standing biomass in reef food webs using a near-pristine tropical reef ecosystem in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean as a model. We focus on We did *in situ* experiments (video link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPeJAe6WuaI)), fish visual censuses and food web modelling to forecast to what extent temperature affects reef fish trophic interactions in the Western Atlantic and modeled projections of changes in reef food web species due to climate change.¬†

## Results obtained

-   By the end of this century reef ecosystem standing biomass is projected to decline by approximately 1 %, 8 %, and 44 %¬†under low, moderate, and high warming scenarios.

-   Ecosystem transfer efficiency will drop by \~2 % and biomass residence time will decrease by \~10 % under the high warming scenario.

-   The result is a simplification of reef communities, with fewer resources and lower resilience to disturbance.
